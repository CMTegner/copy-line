=========
Copy a line from a file to your clipboard

TODO
====
* Figure out what is best practice for cancelling readable streams (convert to non-flowing and stop stream when criteria is reached?)
* Support for xclip and similar (npm install copy-paste?)
* Code style + tests
* Write readme
* Publish to NPM
